# Linux Format 276: CircuitPython

How to use CircuitPython with the Raspberry Pi to control an LED and then how to use an MPR121 capacitive touch sensor to turn an LED on and off.

The QTPy folder contains the same project, but written for [Adafruit's QTPy CircuitPython board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600). All I had to change was the GPIO pin for the LED, and install the MPR121.,py library into the lib folder.
